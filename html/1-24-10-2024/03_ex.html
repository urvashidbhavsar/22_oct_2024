        <b>HTML</b> is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose <mark>text, images, and other
            material</mark>
        into
        visible
        or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and
        these
        characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text
        elements
        are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features
        of early
        text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the <u>CTSS
            (Compatible
            Time-Sharing System)</u> operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by
        typesetters to
        manually <code><mark>format documents</mark></code>. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on
        elements
        (nested
        annotated ranges
        with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
        progressively moved
        in this direction with CSS<sup>[1]</sup>.
